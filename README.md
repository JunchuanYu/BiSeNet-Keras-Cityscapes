# BiSeNet-Keras-Cityscapes
This repo is an implementation of BiSeNet in Keras on the [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/) dataset. But it still has some differences compared with the author's.The code is currently available and will fix issues in the code later.

The context_model contains ResNet18,ResNet50 and Xception which you can use the pretrained model provided by [Keras](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-models/releases).
